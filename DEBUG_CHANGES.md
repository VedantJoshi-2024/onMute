# Debug Changes Summary

## Changes Made to Debug Loading Issues

### 1. Fixed devUtils.ts Syntax Error
- Fixed the invalid `await` statements at the end of the file
- Wrapped them in a proper function `testFreshInstallation()`

### 2. Added Error Boundary
- Created `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` to catch JavaScript errors
- Added it to the main app layout to catch any unhandled errors
- This will show detailed error information instead of the generic "Something went wrong"

### 3. Enhanced Auth Context Debugging
- Added detailed console logging with `[AuthContext]` prefix
- Added a 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading states
- Better error handling and logging

### 4. Enhanced Chat Loading Debugging
- Added detailed console logging with `[ChatIndex]` prefix
- Better tracking of loading states and operations

### 5. Created Debug Screen
- Added `app/debug.tsx` with debugging information
- Shows auth state, chat storage state, and provides dev tools
- Can clear all data to test fresh installation

### 6. Added Debug Access
- Modified `app/index.tsx` to show a debug button during loading (dev mode only)
- Allows access to debug screen when stuck on loading

## How to Debug

1. **If stuck on loading screen**: Tap the "Debug Info" button (only visible in dev mode)
2. **Check console logs**: Look for logs with `[AuthContext]` and `[ChatIndex]` prefixes
3. **Use debug screen**: 
   - Check authentication state
   - Check chat storage state
   - Run storage inspection
   - Clear all data to test fresh installation

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Infinite Loading
- **Cause**: Auth context not resolving
- **Solution**: Check console for `[AuthContext]` logs, 10-second timeout will force exit

### Issue: "Something went wrong" screen
- **Cause**: JavaScript error
- **Solution**: Error boundary will now show detailed error instead

### Issue: Loading stuck on chat screen
- **Cause**: Chat storage operations failing
- **Solution**: Check console for `[ChatIndex]` logs, use debug screen to inspect storage

## Testing Fresh Installation
1. Use debug screen to "Clear All Data"
2. Restart app to simulate fresh installation
3. Should immediately show empty state without loading

## Next Steps
1. Run the app and check console logs
2. If stuck on loading, use the debug button
3. Report any specific error messages from the error boundary or console logs
